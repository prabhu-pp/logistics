The basic overview of this project are defined below:

Models (models.py in log_app):
Your log_app has three models: Zone, City, and Rate.
Zone represents different geographical zones with coordinates.
City represents cities associated with a particular zone.
Rate represents shipping rates between cities within a zone.

Serializers (serializers.py in log_app):
Serializers help convert model data to/from JSON format for API requests and responses.
You have serializers (zoneSerial, citySerial, rateSerial) for each model.


Views (views.py in log_app):
Views handle incoming requests and return responses.
You have viewsets (demozone, democity, demorate) for CRUD operations on each model.
These viewsets inherit from Django REST Framework's ModelViewSet.
The Rate model has a custom save() method for calculating the total rate.


URL Configuration (in log_project/urls.py):
URL patterns map requests to viewsets.
URLs are registered for each viewset under corresponding endpoints (/zone/, /city/, /rate/).

Migrations:
Run python manage.py makemigrations log_app to create migrations for the log_app app.
Run python manage.py migrate to apply migrations and update the database schema.
This setup provides a simple RESTful API for managing zones, cities, and shipping rates in the log_project Django project under the log_app app.
